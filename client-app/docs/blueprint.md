## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Use a muted blue (#6699CC) to evoke trust and stability, fitting for a professional CRM.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0) to maintain a clean, professional backdrop that doesn't distract from the data.
- Accent color: A soft green (#90EE90) will highlight key actions and important information. This accent color is analogous to blue on the color wheel.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) will be used for both body text and headlines due to its modern, neutral, and readable appearance. Inter will bring the technological feeling in alignment with other aspects of the CRM.
- Use clean, modern icons to represent different modules and actions within the CRM.
- Implement a modular layout that supports role-based views and conditional UI loading.
- Subtle animations will enhance user experience, like progress bar transitions, panel expansions, and visual cues for AI insights.
